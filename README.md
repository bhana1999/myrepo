# myrepo

## In this assigment I have to build REST APIs for NFTs.
## I have to build API to create NFTs, get NFTs by Id, get all nft, Delete NFTs, and Update NFTs.
## (With the help of create api we can create new nfts, with the help of get api we can get any particular nft, with the help of getall nfts api we can get all nfts present in our database, with the help of delete we can delete nfts, and with the help of udate we can update any nfts.)
## I have to use aunthentication as well in each API.
## Use authentication for security purpose to user identification.
